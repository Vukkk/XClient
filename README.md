# THE PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## XClient - an extended fake player for Half-Life and mods (including Counter-Strike). 

The first thing you need to know is that XClient isn't a "fake players" program. An one instance of XClient - is one fake player on the server. So you can write your own managing program to operate many XClient's.

The second thing is that XClient isn't a ddos program. Main goal of project is making modern artificial intellegence based on lua scripts.

Currently in alpha on 9 Jul 2017. 

Project written in C++, but there is no code of it. Only lua code is present.
